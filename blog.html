            <h1>Answer For Question 4</h1>
            <p class="question">
            Question : Explain In Depth How Pseudo Elements are different from Pseudo Class Selectors With Examples . 
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements can be a little confusing 
                    until you have it spelt out for you. Basically a pseudo-class is a selector that assists
                    in the selection of something that cannot be expressed by a simple selector, 
                    for example :hover. A pseudo-element however allows us to create items that do not normally 
                    exist in the document tree, for example ``::after`.
                </p>
                <p><h4>Pseudo-classes</h4>

                    Pseudo-classes select regular elements but under certain conditions, like when their
                    position relative to siblings or when they’re under a particular state. <br> 
                    Here is a list of pseudo-classes in CSS3: <br>
                    Dynamic pseudo-classes
                    <ul>
                        <li>:link</li>
                        <li>:visited</li>
                        <li>:hover</li>
                        <li>:active</li>
                        <li>:focus</li>
                    </ul>
                    UI element states pseudo-classes
                    <ul>
                        <li>:enabled</li>
                        <li>:disabled</li>
                        <li>:checked</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    and also contains Structural pseudo-classes like :first-child , :nth-child(n) and Other 
                    pseudo-classes like :not(x) , :target ,:lang(language).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
                    The following example will color all even rows gray (#ccc), all uneven rows which aren't dividable by 5 white and every other row magenta.
                    table tr:nth-child(2n) td{
                        background-color: #ccc;
                    }

                    table tr:nth-child(2n+1) td{
                        background-color: #fff;
                    }

                    table tr:nth-child(2n+1):nth-child(5n) td{
                        background-color: #f0f;
                    }

                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Pseudo-elements</h4>
                    Pseudo-elements effectively create new elements that are not specified in the markup of
                    the document and can be manipulated much like a regular element. With the introduction of 
                    CSS3 the difference between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements is a lot more clear as it 
                    is now the standard to use double colon (::) on pseudo-elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of pseudo-elements in CSS3:
                    <ul>
                        <li>::before</li>
                        <li>::after</li>
                        <li>::first-letter</li>
                        <li>::first-line</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example
                    The following example will add a language-tag to every quote on a given page using 
                    the pseudo-class :lang and the pseudo-element ::after:
                    q:lang(de)::after{
                        content: " (German) ";
                    }
                    
                    q:lang(en)::after{
                        content: " (English) ";
                    }
                    
                    q:lang(fr)::after{
                        content: " (French) ";
                    }
                    
                    q:not(:lang(fr)):not(:lang(de)):not(:lang(en))::after{
                        content: " (Unrecognized language) ";
                    }
                </p>

            <h1>Answer For Question 6</h1>
            <p class="question">
            Question :  Explain the difference between flex layout and grid layout 
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was 
                    designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for 
                    two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time. If u need to control the layout 
                    by row or column – use a flexbox but if u need to control the layout by row and column – use a grid. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Grid is best suited for a few specific use cases (2D obviously, but also things like overlapping 
                    elements) while flexbox usually shines in simpler yet common layout requirements. Use grid when 
                    you already have the layout structure in mind, and flex when you just want everything to fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4> The main difference between grid layout and flexbox layout </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, and Grid for two-dimensional layouts.</li>
                        <li>The approach of CSS Grid is the layout first, while the Flexbox approach is primarily the content.</li>
                        <li>The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is 
                            designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.</li>
                    </ul>
